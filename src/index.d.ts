/*

General idea:
- case-insensitive
- diacritics-insensitive
- works with Latin script, Cyrillic, rudimentary CJK support
- limited fuzzing: matches query letters in order, but they don't have to be consecutive
  (but no or very limited transposition or removals are allowed - they cause more confusion than help)
- no FTS-style stemming, soundex, levenstein, autocorrect - query can be lazy, but not sloppy
- sort by how well text matches the query

Think VS Code/Dash-like search, not Google-like search

## Sorting

Results are sorted in roughly this order:

1. [0]    Exact match (found === query)
2. [0.1]  Full match (like exact, but case&diacritics-insensitive)
3. [0.5]  "Starts with" match
4. [0.9]  Contains query (starting at word boundary) exactly
5. [1]    Contains query (starting at word boundary)
6. [1.5+] Contains query words (space separated) in any order
7. [2]    Contains query
8. [2+]   Contains letters -- the fewer chunks, the better

Note:
- Lower score is better (think "error level")
- Exact scoring values are not an API contract, can change between releases
- Secondary sort criteria (for equal fuzzy sort) is input order
